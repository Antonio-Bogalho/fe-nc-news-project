# Northcoders News Frontend Project

This project is the frontend for my Northcoders News API (backend project link: https://github.com/Antonio-Bogalho/be-nc-news-backend-project).
It interacts with the backend API to display articles, topics, and comments in a user-friendly interface. Users can log in, view and vote on articles, and explore topics like coding, cooking, and football.

Link to the hosted version: https://dancing-youtiao-cd9df1.netlify.app

Minimum requirements: Node.js: v22.7.0 and PostgreSQL: v14.13

Firstly, clone the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/Antonio-Bogalho/fe-nc-news-project.git
Then cd fe-nc-news

Once inside the folder, install all the dependencies using the command: npm install
This will ensure that all dependencies listed in the package.json file are ready to be used.

Once installed, you can run the command: npm run dev
This will use the axios dependency to start the local development server.
You can then access the app at http://localhost:5173/ 

At this point in development, you can login using one of the usernames already in the database such as: tickle122, grumpy19, happyamy2016, cooljmessy, weegembump and jessjelly
Functionality to create a new user with their username, name and avatar will be implemented in the future.

You can manually test the app by interacting with the components and features, this is a project
in active development so more functionality and styling will soon be implemented.

Any queries or feedback don't hesitate to raise it in the Github repository!

This portfolio project was created as part of a Digital Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering provided by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/)
